# rna-seq_tcComp
Comparison of RNA-seq time course differential expression analysis tools

Code used for the study "Comparative analysis of differential gene expression tools for RNA sequencing time course data", organized
in two folders:
- simulation (containing the code used for simulating the data,running tools, summarizing and plotting results of the simulation stuy)
- GSE69822 (containg the code used for preprocessing data, running tools, summarizing and plotting results of the published dataset
)
- Data containing the simulation data. Filenames indicating library size / number of replicates / time points as well as the condition (treat/contr).
